good number for not that many epochs. But there are some other values that deserves 
attention, they are precision, recall and f1-score metrics. What do they mean, briefely?
Precision calculates how many times our model predicted a label for positive 
(1 for pizza for example) and it got correct, recall takes all the predictions 
of positive and check to see how many are actually correct. What can be taken
from that is, if you don't want your model to have false positives
(predicting 1 when actually should be 0) you should try to increase
precision, and if you don't want your model to have false negatives
(predicting 0 when it should be 1)  you should try to increase your recall 
(please note that if you increase recall, you get a lower precision
and vice-versa, for more look into precision recall tradeoff)""")
